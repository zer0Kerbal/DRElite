		// The following params for the stock heat shield change how fast
		// it's consumed, the relationship of part temp and external temp,
		// etc. They're no longer modified because it's enough to make the
		// shield max temp sane and make it fail on depletion.
		//

		// Heat offset by each unit of ablator. Increasing this lowers the heat
		// shield temp and lowers ablator burn rate, also the total heat the
		// ablator can ever offset when maxed. Small changes effective, linear.
		//
		// I don't decrease this because I want to be able to carry plenty of
		// ablator for interplanetary re-entries, and because it
		// increases required ablator mass excessively.

		//@pyrolysisLossFactor *= 1

		// Base rate of ablator burn. Increasing this increases ablator burn rate
		// and lowers temp (more units of ablator burned = more heat offset).
		// Small changes effective, linear.
		//@lossConst *= 0.08

		// Temp offset for ablation. Below this temp no ablation happens. Also
		// seems to affect the heat scaling above the threshold, lowering
		// burn rate for a given lossExp. I want ablator to have a much higher
		// resilience to gentle re-entry, mainly so it doesn't all burn off before
		// the final re-entry when doing repeated passes for aerocapture.
		//@ablationTempThresh = 2000

		// Nonlinear factor (possibly exponent) of ablator burn rate.
		// Increasing this makes ablator burn slower and increases temp, so it
		// acts in the opposite direction to lossConst.
		//@lossExp *= 0.003

		// Conductivity during re-entry when not depleted. This should really only
		// apply when pyrolysis is active and should be proportionate to the rate
		// of pyrolysis. But it isn't, it's just magic. Nevermind.
